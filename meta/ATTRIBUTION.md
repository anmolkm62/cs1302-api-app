# Assets

Modify this file to satisfy a submission requirement related to providing
proper attribution for all assets (e.g., art, sound, music, etc.) that
you include in your project, especially assets that you did not personally

this file in your GitHub repository website, then you will see that the
Markdown is transformed into nice-looking HTML.

### Authored Assets
My project does not use any local images or sounds. I used only JavaFX and CSS Styling.
